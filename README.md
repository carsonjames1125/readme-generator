# Professional README Generator

## Description

This project was designed to make a tidious process, like creating a readme for a repository much easier and quicker for the user. A Readme file may seem very annoying to many coders, but a vital part of the repository nonetheless. This project does everything with creating the readme for the user and organizes it all into a professional readme document. 

## Installation

To install this project I begain by by using node and npm i to install inquirer to my project, from there, i used the starter code provided. I build onto the starter code and created a readme application. After linking the documents together, I ran node index from the command line and let the application do the rest.
